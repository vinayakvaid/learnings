Series
	
	Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index. Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet.
	Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object supports both integer and label-based indexing and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index.
	
	> Creating series from python list
		import numpy as np
		import pandas as pd
		labels = ["a","b","c"]
		my_data = [10,20,30]
		arr = np.array(my_data)
		d = {"a":10, "b":20, "c":30}
		series1 = pd.Series(data=my_data)
		print(series1)
		
		output - here we get 0,1,2 as index and 10,20,30 as their values, its similar to numpy array except it has indexes
		0    10
		1    20
		2    30
		dtype: int64 
	
	> Creating series from python list with index
		import numpy as np
		import pandas as pd
		labels = ["a","b","c"]
		my_data = [10,20,30]
		arr = np.array(my_data)
		d = {"a":10, "b":20, "c":30}
		series1 = pd.Series(my_data,labels)
		print(series1)
		
		output - here we have specified index, so this is indexed series with indexes of our choice
		a    10
		b    20
		c    30
		dtype: int64

		d = {"a":10, "b":20, "c":30}

		print(series1)
		
		output -
		a    10
		b    20
		c    30
		dtype: int32
		
		
	> Creating series from dictionary
		import pandas as pd
		d = {"a":10, "b":20, "c":30}
		series1 = pd.Series(d)
		print(series1)
		
		output - here keys of a dictionary are put as indexes
		a    10
		b    20
		c    30
		dtype: int64
		
		
	> You can also store other object types than numbers in series which differentiates it from numpy array
		import pandas as pd
		series1 = pd.Series([print,len,sum])
		print(series1)
		
		output-
		0    <built-in function print>
		1      <built-in function len>
		2      <built-in function sum>
		dtype: object
		

	> Accessing values from series
		import pandas as pd
		series1 = pd.Series([1,2,3,4],["USA","Germany","USSR","Japan"])
		print(series1)
		print(series1["Germany"])
		
		output-
		USA        1
		Germany    2
		USSR       3
		Japan      4
		dtype: int64
		2
		
	> If we try to add two series, it will add the values if possible based on similar indexes but where it doesnt find the similar index, it will give Nan
	  Also, interger numbers have been added and chnaged to float, this is done in order to ratain all the information possible
		import pandas as pd
		series1 = pd.Series([1,2,3,4],["USA","Germany","USSR","Japan"])
		series2 = pd.Series([1,2,5,4],["USA","Germany","Italy","Japan"])
		print(series1)
		print(series2)
		print(series1 + series2)
		
		output-
		USA        1
		Germany    2
		USSR       3
		Japan      4
		dtype: int64
		USA        1
		Germany    2
		Italy      5
		Japan      4
		dtype: int64
		Germany    4.0
		Italy      NaN
		Japan      8.0
		USA        2.0
		USSR       NaN
		dtype: float64
