Introduction
	Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

 
	Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code. For examples, see the sample plots and thumbnail gallery.

	For simple plotting the pyplot module provides a MATLAB-like interface, particularly when combined with IPython. For the power user, you have full control of line styles, font properties, axes properties, etc, via an object oriented interface or via a set of functions familiar to MATLAB users.
	
	Matplotlib is the "grandfather" library of data visualization with Python. It was created by John Hunter. He created it to try to replicate MatLab's (another programming language) plotting capabilities in Python. So if you happen to be familiar with matlab, matplotlib will feel natural to you.

	It is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for generating scientific figures.

	Some of the major Pros of Matplotlib are:

	Generally easy to get started for simple plots
	Support for custom labels and texts
	Great control of every element in a figure
	High-quality output in many formats
	Very customizable in general
	Matplotlib allows you to create reproducible figures programmatically. Let's learn how to use it! Before continuing this lecture, I encourage you just to explore the official Matplotlib web page: http://matplotlib.org/
	
		> Matplotlib is the most popular plotting library for python
		> It gives you control over every aspect of a figure
		> It was designed to have a similar feel to Matlab's graphical plotting
		> It works very well with Pandas and Numpy
